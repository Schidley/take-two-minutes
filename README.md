# take-two-minutes
A mental health aweness project

Take2minutes is my first project developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Developer programme. I will utilise HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap to fulfil all of the learning outcomes expected. 

In today's fast-paced world, it's all too easy to get caught up in the demands of work, school, and everyday life. As a result, we often neglect the importance of taking regular breaks to recharge our minds and bodies. The purpose of this website is to promote the practice of taking short breaks and to highlight the mental health benefits associated with this simple yet powerful habit.

Mental Health Benefits of Short Breaks
Reduced Stress Levels: Taking short breaks throughout the day can significantly reduce stress levels. Stepping away from a stressful task or environment allows the mind to relax and reset. This helps in lowering cortisol levels, the hormone associated with stress, and promotes a sense of calm and well-being.

Improved Focus and Productivity: Regular breaks can enhance focus and productivity. Continuous work without breaks can lead to mental fatigue, decreasing concentration and efficiency. Short breaks provide an opportunity to rest and recharge, resulting in improved cognitive function and better overall performance.

Enhanced Creativity: Short breaks can boost creativity. Engaging in different activities or simply taking a moment to relax can stimulate new ideas and fresh perspectives. Breaks create mental space for creativity to flourish, leading to more innovative solutions and problem-solving skills.

Prevention of Burnout: Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress. Taking regular breaks helps prevent burnout by allowing individuals to manage their workload more effectively and maintain a healthy work-life balance. This promotes long-term mental well-being and resilience.

Better Physical Health: Short breaks that involve physical movement, such as stretching or walking, can improve physical health. Regular movement reduces the risk of musculoskeletal issues and promotes better circulation. Physical activity also releases endorphins, which contribute to a positive mood and overall mental health.

By creating a website dedicated to taking short breaks, we aim to promote a culture of self-care and mental well-being. Regular breaks are a simple yet effective way to reduce stress, enhance productivity, and improve overall mental health. Let's take a step towards a healthier, happier, and more balanced life, one break at a time.

(The above preamble was prototyped by ai, and edited to fit the specific needs of the project, cutting down significantly on development time)

I have sourced code snippets from Bootstrap documentation (carousel), from AI suggestion, and from StackOverflow (Scrolling issues)
Favicons are from Favicon.io

## Validation

The website passed vidation from https://validator.w3.org/ as below

and passed CSS validation from https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ as below

## Learning Outcomes

Front end design is responsive, mobile first (inherited from bootstrap) and has a consistent theme.
The user experience was designed to be minimalist and relaxing
Both HTML and CSS validated correctly.
My website design responds to being displayed on different devices.
The website has been deployed globally, via Github Pages
A readme file was made to document the goals and learning outcomes.
AI was consulted at a number of key points. As an example, the 'About' text was fleshed out by Copilot, and code snippets such as
the method used for using a local favicon rather than an online example. AI was also consulted for some issues that arose, 
including arriving at a solution for integration of bootstrap grid and flexbox placements on the same page.
AI improved the UX experience of the website by allowing more time to be spent on achieving the desired look, using the time
saved on AI driven development aspects.
AI overall sped up the development process, I believe, although this does have to be weighed against the time
spent coaching the AI into giving concise and helpful advice. 

## Further scope

Given more time, I would focus on replacing the remaining placeholder text with content, and aquire and curate more suitable images for the contemplation page.
